# How To Use Q/A section

In case of issues, I would highly encourage you to debug yourself first. Debugging is the best way to learn and understand the mistakes. 

## Debug yourself

- I would highly encourage you to use the **pom dependencies version and docker image versions** I provide even if they are NOT latest. I will update periodically. However sometimes, there are some known issues. So I carefully test and provide the updated versions.

    - [Maven dependencies](../03-automation-framework/dependencies.md)
    - [Docker Images](../04-selenium-grid/docker-images.md)
- Compare your project with mine. You can use tools like **WinMerge** to compare multiple files.
- Worst case, clone my project and see if it works.

## Q/A Template

Do note that single line issue description / some error screenshots might not help to clarify any issues. Follow this format.

- What is your OS?
- In which lecture you start facing the issue?
- Before this lecture, was everything working fine?
- List the changes you did specific to lecture with code samples / screenshots
- Upload your project in Github and share the link
